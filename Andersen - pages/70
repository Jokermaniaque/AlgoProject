was falling after the other; and when the lights in the palace had all
gradually disappeared, the Raven led little Gerda to the back door,
which stood half open.
Oh, how Gerda’s heart beat with anxiety and longing! It was just
as if she had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only
wanted to know if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She
called to mind his intelligent eyes, and his long hair, so vividly, she
could quite see him as he used to laugh when they were sitting under the roses at home. “He will, no doubt, be glad to see you to
hear what a long way you have come for his sake; to know how

Oh, what a fright and a joy it was!
They were now on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there;

They now entered the first saloon, which was of rose-colored satin,
with artificial flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were rushing
past, but they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the
high personages. One hall was more magnificent than the other;
one might indeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the
bedchamber. The ceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree
with leaves of glass, of costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick
golden stem, hung two beds, each of which resembled a lily. One
