“If your Imperial Majesty will be graciously pleased to take off
your clothes, we will fit on the new suit, in front of the looking
glass.”
The Emperor was accordingly undressed, and the rogues pretended
to array him in his new suit; the Emperor turning round, from side
to side, before the looking glass.
“How splendid his Majesty looks in his new clothes, and how
well they fit!” everyone cried out. “What a design! What colors!
These are indeed royal robes!”
“The canopy which is to be borne over your Majesty, in the procession, is waiting,” announced the chief master of the ceremonies.
“I am quite ready,” answered the Emperor. “Do my new clothes fit
well?” asked he, turning himself round again before the looking glass,
in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit.
The lords of the bedchamber, who were to carry his Majesty’s
train felt about on the ground, as if they were lifting up the ends of
the mantle; and pretended to be carrying something; for they would
by no means betray anything like simplicity, or unfitness for their
office.
So now the Emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst
of the procession, through the streets of his capital; and all the people
standing by, and those at the windows, cried out, “Oh! How beautiful are our Emperor’s new clothes! What a magnificent train there
is to the mantle; and how gracefully the scarf hangs!” in short, no
one would allow that he could not see these much-admired clothes;
because, in doing so, he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office. Certainly, none of the Emperor’s various
suits, had ever made so great an impression, as these invisible ones.
“But the Emperor has nothing at all on!” said a little child.
“Listen to the voice of innocence!” exclaimed his father; and what
the child had said was whispered from one to another.
“But he has nothing at all on!” at last cried out all the people. The
Emperor was vexed, for he knew that the people were right; but he
thought the procession must go on now! And the lords of the
bedchamber took greater pains than ever, to appear holding up a
train, although, in reality, there was no train to hold.
