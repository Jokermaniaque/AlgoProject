THE LEAP-FROG
A FLEA , A GRASSHOPPER , AND A LEAP-FROG once wanted to see which
could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else besides who chose to come to see the festival. Three famous jumpers were they, as everyone would say, when they all met
together in the room.
“I will give my daughter to him who jumps highest,” exclaimed
the King; “for it is not so amusing where there is no prize to jump
for.”
The Flea was the first to step forward. He had exquisite manners,
and bowed to the company on all sides; for he had noble blood, and
was, moreover, accustomed to the society of man alone; and that
makes a great difference.
Then came the Grasshopper. He was considerably heavier, but he
was well-mannered, and wore a green uniform, which he had by right
of birth; he said, moreover, that he belonged to a very ancient Egyptian family, and that in the house where he then was, he was thought
much of. The fact was, he had been just brought out of the fields, and
put in a pasteboard house, three stories high, all made of court-cards,
with the colored side inwards; and doors and windows cut out of the
body of the Queen of Hearts. “I sing so well,” said he, “that sixteen
native grasshoppers who have chirped from infancy, and yet got no
house built of cards to live in, grew thinner than they were before for
sheer vexation when they heard me.”
It was thus that the Flea and the Grasshopper gave an account of
themselves, and thought they were quite good enough to marry a
Princess.
The Leap-frog said nothing; but people gave it as their opinion,
that he therefore thought the more; and when the housedog snuffed
at him with his nose, he confessed the Leap-frog was of good family.
