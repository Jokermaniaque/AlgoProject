THE STORY OF A MOTHER
A MOTHER SAT THERE with her little child. She was so downcast, so
afraid that it should die! It was so pale, the small eyes had closed
themselves, and it drew its breath so softly, now and then, with a
deep respiration, as if it sighed; and the mother looked still more
sorrowfully on the little creature.
Then a knocking was heard at the door, and in came a poor old
man wrapped up as in a large horse-cloth, for it warms one, and he
needed it, as it was the cold winter season! Everything out-of-doors
was covered with ice and snow, and the wind blew so that it cut the
face.
As the old man trembled with cold, and the little child slept a
moment, the mother went and poured some ale into a pot and set it
on the stove, that it might be warm for him; the old man sat and
rocked the cradle, and the mother sat down on a chair close by him,
and looked at her little sick child that drew its breath so deep, and
raised its little hand.
“Do you not think that I shall save him?” said she. “Our Lord will
not take him from me!”
And the old man it was Death himself he nodded so strangely,
it could just as well signify yes as no. And the mother looked down
in her lap, and the tears ran down over her cheeks; her head became
so heavy she had not closed her eyes for three days and nights;
and now she slept, but only for a minute, when she started up and
trembled with cold.
“What is that?” said she, and looked on all sides; but the old man
was gone, and her little child was gone he had taken it with him;
and the old clock in the corner burred, and burred, the great leaden
weight ran down to the floor, bump! and then the clock also stood
still.
