“Is it true that you have taken my little playfellow? I will make
you a present of my red shoes, if you will give him back to me.”
And, as it seemed to her, the blue waves nodded in a strange manner; then she took off her red shoes, the most precious things she
possessed, and threw them both into the river. But they fell close to
the bank, and the little waves bore them immediately to land; it was
as if the stream would not take what was dearest to her; for in reality
it had not got little Kay; but Gerda thought that she had not thrown
the shoes out far enough, so she clambered into a boat which lay
among the rushes, went to the farthest end, and threw out the shoes.
But the boat was not fastened, and the motion which she occasioned, made it drift from the shore. She observed this, and hastened to get back; but before she could do so, the boat was more

Little Gerda was very frightened, and began to cry; but no one
heard her except the sparrows, and they could not carry her to land;
but they flew along the bank, and sang as if to comfort her, “Here
we are! Here we are!” The boat drifted with the stream, little Gerda
sat quite still without shoes, for they were swimming behind the
boat, but she could not reach them, because the boat went much
faster than they did.
The banks on both sides were beautiful; lovely flowers, venerable
trees, and slopes with sheep and cows, but not a human being was

“Perhaps the river will carry me to little Kay,” said she; and then
she grew less sad. She rose, and looked for many hours at the beautiful green banks. Presently she sailed by a large cherry-orchard,
where was a little cottage with curious red and blue windows; it was
thatched, and before it two wooden soldiers stood sentry, and presented arms when anyone went past.
Gerda called to them, for she thought they were alive; but they, of
course, did not answer. She came close to them, for the stream drifted
the boat quite near the land.
Gerda called still louder, and an old woman then came out of the
cottage, leaning upon a crooked stick. She had a large broad-brimmed
hat on, painted with the most splendid flowers.
“Poor little child!” said the old woman. “How did you get upon
