they burned down they were put out one after the other, and then
the children had permission to plunder the Tree. So they fell upon it
with such violence that all its branches cracked; if it had not been
fixed firmly in the ground, it would certainly have tumbled down.
The children danced about with their beautiful playthings; no
one looked at the Tree except the old nurse, who peeped between
the branches; but it was only to see if there was a fig or an apple left
that had been forgotten.
“A story! A story!” cried the children, drawing a little fat man
towards the Tree. He seated himself under it and said, “Now we are
in the shade, and the Tree can listen too. But I shall tell only one
story. Now which will you have; that about Ivedy-Avedy, or about
Humpy-Dumpy, who tumbled downstairs, and yet after all came to
the throne and married the princess?”
“Ivedy-Avedy,” cried some; “Humpy-Dumpy,” cried the others.
There was such a bawling and screaming the Fir Tree alone was
silent, and he thought to himself, “Am I not to bawl with the rest?
Am I to do nothing whatever?” for he was one of the company, and
had done what he had to do.
And the man told about Humpy-Dumpy that tumbled down,
who notwithstanding came to the throne, and at last married the
princess. And the children clapped their hands, and cried. “Oh, go
on! Do go on!” They wanted to hear about Ivedy-Avedy too, but the
little man only told them about Humpy-Dumpy. The Fir Tree stood
quite still and absorbed in thought; the birds in the wood had never
related the like of this. “Humpy-Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he
married the princess! Yes, yes! That’s the way of the world!” thought
the Fir Tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story
was so good-looking. “Well, well! who knows, perhaps I may fall
downstairs, too, and get a princess as wife!” And he looked forward
with joy to the morrow, when he hoped to be decked out again with
lights, playthings, fruits, and tinsel.
“I won’t tremble to-morrow!” thought the Fir Tree. “I will enjoy
to the full all my splendor! To-morrow I shall hear again the story of
Humpy-Dumpy, and perhaps that of Ivedy-Avedy too.” And the
whole night the Tree stood still and in deep thought.
In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.
