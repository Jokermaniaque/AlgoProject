The sun now set: the atmosphere glowed like fire. It was still in
the woods, so very still; and he fell on his knees, sung his evening
hymn, and said: “I cannot find what I seek; the sun is going down,
and night is coming the dark, dark night. Yet perhaps I may be
able once more to see the round red sun before he entirely disappears. I will climb up yonder rock.”
And he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of trees 
climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing
and the toads were croaking and he gained the summit before the
sun had quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this
height! The sea the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long
waves against the coast was stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet, stood the sun, like a large shining altar,
all melted together in the most glowing colors. And the wood and
the sea sang a song of rejoicing, and his heart sang with the rest: all
nature was a vast holy church, in which the trees and the buoyant
clouds were the pillars, flowers and grass the velvet carpeting, and
heaven itself the large cupola. The red colors above faded away as
the sun vanished, but a million stars were lighted, a million lamps
shone; and the King’s Son spread out his arms towards heaven, and
wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to the
right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor boy who
had been confirmed with him. He had followed his own path, and
had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done.
They ran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in
the vast church of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded
the invisible holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted
up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!
