her with power over the whole?”
“I can give her no more power than what she has already. Don’t
you see how great it is? Don’t you see how men and animals are
forced to serve her; how well she gets through the world barefooted?
She must not hear of her power from us; that power lies in her
heart, because she is a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to
the Snow Queen by herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the little girl. Set her down by the large
bush with red berries, standing in the snow; don’t stay talking, but
hasten back as fast as possible.” And now the Finland woman placed
little Gerda on the Reindeer’s back, and off he ran with all imaginable speed.
“Oh! I have not got my boots! I have not brought my gloves!”
cried little Gerda. She remarked she was without them from the
cutting frost; but the Reindeer dared not stand still; on he ran till he
came to the great bush with the red berries, and there he set Gerda
down, kissed her mouth, while large bright tears flowed from the
animal’s eyes, and then back he went as fast as possible. There stood

quite bright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran
along the ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew.
Gerda well remembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she once saw them through a magnifying-glass; but
now they were large and terrific in another manner they were all
alive. They were the outposts of the Snow Queen. They had the
most wondrous shapes; some looked like large ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their heads sticking out; and
others, again, like small fat bears, with the hair standing on end: all
were of dazzling whiteness all were living snow-flakes.
Little Gerda repeated the Lord’s Prayer. The cold was so intense
that she could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of
her mouth. It grew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little
angels, that grew more and more when they touched the earth. All
