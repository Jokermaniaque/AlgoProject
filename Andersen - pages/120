sweet thoughts from it. Yet it was like a piece of enchantment. And
who lived there? Where was the actual entrance? The whole of the
ground-floor was a row of shops, and there people could not always
be running through.
One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt
in the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow
should fall on his opposite neighbor’s wall. Yes! there it sat, directly
opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger
moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.
“I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there,”
said the learned man. “See, how nicely it sits between the flowers.
The door stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning,
and go into the room, look about, and then come and tell me what
it had seen. Come, now! Be useful, and do me a service,” said he, in
jest. “Have the kindness to step in. Now! Art thou going?” and then
he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow nodded again. “Well
then, go! But don’t stay away.”
The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor’s balcony rose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned
round. Yes! if anyone had paid particular attention to it, they would
have seen, quite distinctly, that the shadow went in through the halfopen balcony-door of their opposite neighbor, just as the stranger
went into his own room, and let the long curtain fall down after him.
Next morning, the learned man went out to drink coffee and read
the newspapers.
“What is that?” said he, as he came out into the sunshine. “I have
no shadow! So then, it has actually gone last night, and not come
again. It is really tiresome!”
This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone,
but because he knew there was a story about a man without a
shadow.* It was known to everybody at home, in the cold lands;
and if the learned man now came there and told his story, they
would say that he was imitating it, and that he had no need to do.
He would, therefore, not talk about it at all; and that was wisely
thought.
