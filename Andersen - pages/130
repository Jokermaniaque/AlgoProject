THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL
MOST TERRIBLY COLD it was; it snowed, and was nearly quite dark,
and evening the last evening of the year. In this cold and darkness
there went along the street a poor little girl, bareheaded, and with
naked feet. When she left home she had slippers on, it is true; but

little feet she had drawn close up to her, but she grew colder and
colder, and to go home she did not venture, for she had not sold any
matches and could not bring a farthing of money: from her father
she would certainly get blows, and at home it was cold too, for
