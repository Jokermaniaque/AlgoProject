of dazzling, sparkling ice; yet she lived; her eyes gazed fixedly, like two
stars; but there was neither quiet nor repose in them. She nodded
towards the window, and beckoned with her hand. The little boy was
frightened, and jumped down from the chair; it seemed to him as if,
at the same moment, a large bird flew past the window.
The next day it was a sharp frost and then the spring came; the
sun shone, the green leaves appeared, the swallows built their nests,
the windows were opened, and the little children again sat in their
pretty garden, high up on the leads at the top of the house.
That summer the roses flowered in unwonted beauty. The little
girl had learned a hymn, in which there was something about roses;
and then she thought of her own flowers; and she sang the verse to
the little boy, who then sang it with her:
“The rose in the valley is blooming so sweet,
And angels descend there the children to greet.”
And the children held each other by the hand, kissed the roses,
looked up at the clear sunshine, and spoke as though they really saw
angels there. What lovely summer-days those were! How delightful
to be out in the air, near the fresh rose-bushes, that seem as if they
would never finish blossoming!
Kay and Gerda looked at the picture-book full of beasts and of
birds; and it was then the clock in the church-tower was just striking five that Kay said, “Oh! I feel such a sharp pain in my heart;
and now something has got into my eye!”
The little girl put her arms around his neck. He winked his eyes;
now there was nothing to be seen.
“I think it is out now,” said he; but it was not. It was just one of
those pieces of glass from the magic mirror that had got into his eye;
and poor Kay had got another piece right in his heart. It will soon
become like ice. It did not hurt any longer, but there it was.
“What are you crying for?” asked he. “You look so ugly! There’s
nothing the matter with me. Ah,” said he at once, “that rose is cankered! And look, this one is quite crooked! After all, these roses are
very ugly! They are just like the box they are planted in!” And then he
gave the box a good kick with his foot, and pulled both the roses up.
