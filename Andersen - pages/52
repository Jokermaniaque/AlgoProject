“I!” said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.
“Yes, in reality those were happy times.” And then he told about
Christmas-eve, when he was decked out with cakes and candles.
“Oh,” said the little Mice, “how fortunate you have been, old Fir
Tree!”
“I am by no means old,” said he. “I came from the wood this
winter; I am in my prime, and am only rather short for my age.”
“What delightful stories you know,” said the Mice: and the next
night they came with four other little Mice, who were to hear what
the Tree recounted: and the more he related, the more he remembered himself; and it appeared as if those times had really been happy
times. “But they may still come they may still come! HumpyDumpy fell downstairs, and yet he got a princess!” and he thought

“No,” said the Tree.
“Then good-bye,” said the Rats; and they went home.
At last the little Mice stayed away also; and the Tree sighed: “After
all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little Mice sat round me, and
listened to what I told them. Now that too is over. But I will take
good care to enjoy myself when I am brought out again.”
But when was that to be? Why, one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved,
the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard, it is true down
on the floor, but a man drew him towards the stairs, where the
