and asses’ ears, and the flowers grew just as they liked. One of the
pots was quite overrun on all sides with pinks, that is to say, with
the green part; shoot stood by shoot, and it said quite distinctly,
“The air has cherished me, the sun has kissed me, and promised me
a little flower on Sunday! a little flower on Sunday!”
And then they entered a chamber where the walls were covered
with hog’s leather, and printed with gold flowers.
“The gilding decays,
But hog’s leather stays!”
said the walls.
And there stood easy-chairs, with such high backs, and so carved
out, and with arms on both sides. “Sit down! sit down!” said they.
“Ugh! how I creak; now I shall certainly get the gout, like the old
clothespress, ugh!”
And then the little boy came into the room where the projecting
windows were, and where the old man sat.
“I thank you for the pewter soldier, my little friend!” said the old
man. “And I thank you because you come over to me.”
“Thankee! thankee!” or “cranky! cranky!” sounded from all the
furniture; there was so much of it, that each article stood in the
other’s way, to get a look at the little boy.
In the middle of the wall hung a picture representing a beautiful
lady, so young, so glad, but dressed quite as in former times, with
clothes that stood quite stiff, and with powder in her hair; she neither said “thankee, thankee!” nor “cranky, cranky!” but looked with
her mild eyes at the little boy, who directly asked the old man, “Where
did you get her?”
“Yonder, at the broker’s,” said the old man, “where there are so
many pictures hanging. No one knows or cares about them, for they
are all of them buried; but I knew her in by-gone days, and now she
has been dead and gone these fifty years!”
Under the picture, in a glazed frame, there hung a bouquet of
withered flowers; they were almost fifty years old; they looked so
very old!
