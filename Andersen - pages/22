he; “the leather is so soft and supple.” They fitted his feet as though
they had been made for him. “’Tis a curious world we live in,” continued he, soliloquizing. “There is the lieutenant, now, who might
go quietly to bed if he chose, where no doubt he could stretch himself at his ease; but does he do it? No; he saunters up and down his
room, because, probably, he has enjoyed too many of the good things
of this world at his dinner. That’s a happy fellow! He has neither an
infirm mother, nor a whole troop of everlastingly hungry children
to torment him. Every evening he goes to a party, where his nice
supper costs him nothing: would to Heaven I could but change
with him! How happy should I be!”
While expressing his wish, the charm of the shoes, which he had
put on, began to work; the watchman entered into the being and
nature of the lieutenant. He stood in the handsomely furnished
apartment, and held between his fingers a small sheet of rose-colored paper, on which some verses were written written indeed by
the officer himself; for who has not, at least once in his life, had a
lyrical moment? And if one then marks down one’s thoughts, poetry is produced. But here was written:
OH, WERE I RICH!
“Oh, were I rich! Such was my wish, yea such
When hardly three feet high, I longed for much.
Oh, were I rich! an officer were I,
With sword, and uniform, and plume so high.
And the time came, and officer was I!
But yet I grew not rich. Alas, poor me!
Have pity, Thou, who all man’s wants dost see.
“I sat one evening sunk in dreams of bliss,
A maid of seven years old gave me a kiss,
I at that time was rich in poesy
And tales of old, though poor as poor could be;
But all she asked for was this poesy.
Then was I rich, but not in gold, poor me!
As Thou dost know, who all men’s hearts canst see.
