and speaks upon the stage, so entirely in character, and with the same
tone of voice, that none of us, when awake, were able to imitate it. How
well can she recall persons to our mind, of whom we have not thought
for years; when suddenly they step forth “every inch a man,” resembling the real personages, even to the finest features, and become the
heroes or heroines of our world of dreams. In reality, such remembrances are rather unpleasant: every sin, every evil thought, may, like a
clock with alarm or chimes, be repeated at pleasure; then the question is
if we can trust ourselves to give an account of every unbecoming word
in our heart and on our lips.
The watchman’s spirit understood the language of the inhabitants
of the moon pretty well. The Selenites* disputed variously about
our earth, and expressed their doubts if it could be inhabited: the
air, they said, must certainly be too dense to allow any rational dweller
in the moon the necessary free respiration. They considered the moon
alone to be inhabited: they imagined it was the real heart of the
universe or planetary system, on which the genuine Cosmopolites,
or citizens of the world, dwelt. What strange things men no, what
strange things Selenites sometimes take into their heads!
About politics they had a good deal to say. But little Denmark
must take care what it is about, and not run counter to the moon;
that great realm, that might in an ill-humor bestir itself, and dash
down a hail-storm in our faces, or force the Baltic to overflow the
sides of its gigantic basin.
We will, therefore, not listen to what was spoken, and on no condition run in the possibility of telling tales out of school; but we will
rather proceed, like good quiet citizens, to East Street, and observe
what happened meanwhile to the body of the watchman.
He sat lifeless on the steps: the morning-star,** that is to say, the
heavy wooden staff, headed with iron spikes, and which had nothing
else in common with its sparkling brother in the sky, had glided from
his hand; while his eyes were fixed with glassy stare on the moon,
looking for the good old fellow of a spirit which still haunted it.
