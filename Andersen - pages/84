The old councillor, who had had three orders given him to make
him hold his tongue, asserted that the Leap-frog was a prophet; for
that one could see on his back, if there would be a severe or mild
winter, and that was what one could not see even on the back of the
man who writes the almanac.
“I say nothing, it is true,” exclaimed the King; “but I have my
own opinion, notwithstanding.”
Now the trial was to take place. The Flea jumped so high that
nobody could see where he went to; so they all asserted he had not
jumped at all; and that was dishonorable.
The Grasshopper jumped only half as high; but he leaped into
the King’s face, who said that was ill-mannered.
The Leap-frog stood still for a long time lost in thought; it was
believed at last he would not jump at all.
“I only hope he is not unwell,” said the house-dog; when, pop! he
made a jump all on one side into the lap of the Princess, who was
sitting on a little golden stool close by.
Hereupon the King said, “There is nothing above my daughter;
therefore to bound up to her is the highest jump that can be made;
but for this, one must possess understanding, and the Leap-frog has
shown that he has understanding. He is brave and intellectual.”
And so he won the Princess.
“It’s all the same to me,” said the Flea. “She may have the old
Leap-frog, for all I care. I jumped the highest; but in this world
merit seldom meets its reward. A fine exterior is what people look at
now-a-days.”
The Flea then went into foreign service, where, it is said, he was
killed.
The Grasshopper sat without on a green bank, and reflected on
worldly things; and he said too, “Yes, a fine exterior is everything 
a fine exterior is what people care about.” And then he began chirping his peculiar melancholy song, from which we have taken this
history; and which may, very possibly, be all untrue, although it
does stand here printed in black and white.
