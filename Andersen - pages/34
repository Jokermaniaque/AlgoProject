“At all events it must be those which are wet,” thought he; but this
time, in spite of his cleverness, he guessed quite wrong, for it was
just those of Fortune which played as it were into his hands, or
rather on his feet. And why, I should like to know, are the police
never to be wrong? So he put them on quickly, stuck his papers in
his pocket, and took besides a few under his arm, intending to look
them through at home to make the necessary notes. It was noon;
and the weather, that had threatened rain, began to clear up, while
gaily dressed holiday folks filled the streets. “A little trip to
Fredericksburg would do me no great harm,” thought he; “for I,
poor beast of burden that I am, have so much to annoy me, that I

everybody has something agreeable to say to you, and you are always your own master. No, friend, you should but try what it is to
sit from one year’s end to the other occupied with and judging the
most trivial matters.”
The poet shook his head, the copying-clerk did the same. Each
one kept to his own opinion, and so they separated.
“It’s a strange race, those poets!” said the clerk, who was very fond
of soliloquizing. “I should like some day, just for a trial, to take such
nature upon me, and be a poet myself; I am very sure I should make
no such miserable verses as the others. Today, methinks, is a most
delicious day for a poet. Nature seems anew to celebrate her awakening
