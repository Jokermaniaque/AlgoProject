THE HAPPY FAMILY
REALLY, THE LARGEST GREEN LEAF in this country is a dock-leaf; if one
holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over
one’s head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for
it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where
there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and
all this delightfulness is snails’ food. The great white snails which
persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said,
“Hem, hem! how delicious!” for they thought it tasted so delicate 
lived on dock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds were sown.
Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate
snails, they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct,
they grew and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could
not get the mastery over them it was a whole forest of burdocks.
Here and there stood an apple and a plum-tree, or else one never
would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and
there lived the two last venerable old snails.
They themselves knew not how old they were, but they could
remember very well that there had been many more; that they were
of a family from foreign lands, and that for them and theirs the
whole forest was planted. They had never been outside it, but they
knew that there was still something more in the world, which was
called the manor-house, and that there they were boiled, and then
they became black, and were then placed on a silver dish; but what
happened further they knew not; or, in fact, what it was to be boiled,
and to lie on a silver dish, they could not possibly imagine; but it
was said to be delightful, and particularly genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they asked about it could
give them any information none of them had been boiled or laid
on a silver dish.
