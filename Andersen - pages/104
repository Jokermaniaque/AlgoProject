was a ruin. One could see from the street right into the room with
the hog’s-leather hanging, which was slashed and torn; and the green
grass and leaves about the balcony hung quite wild about the falling
beams. And then it was put to rights.
“That was a relief,” said the neighboring houses.
A fine house was built there, with large windows, and smooth
white walls; but before it, where the old house had in fact stood,
was a little garden laid out, and a wild grapevine ran up the wall of
the neighboring house. Before the garden there was a large iron
railing with an iron door, it looked quite splendid, and people stood
still and peeped in, and the sparrows hung by scores in the vine, and
chattered away at each other as well as they could, but it was not
about the old house, for they could not remember it, so many years
had passed so many that the little boy had grown up to a whole
man, yes, a clever man, and a pleasure to his parents; and he had
just been married, and, together with his little wife, had come to
live in the house here, where the garden was; and he stood by her
there whilst she planted a field-flower that she found so pretty; she
planted it with her little hand, and pressed the earth around it with
her fingers. Oh! what was that? She had stuck herself. There sat
something pointed, straight out of the soft mould.
It was yes, guess! It was the pewter soldier, he that was lost up at
the old man’s, and had tumbled and turned about amongst the timber and the rubbish, and had at last laid for many years in the ground.
The young wife wiped the dirt off the soldier, first with a green
leaf, and then with her fine handkerchief it had such a delightful
smell, that it was to the pewter soldier just as if he had awaked from
a trance.
“Let me see him,” said the young man. He laughed, and then
shook his head. “Nay, it cannot be he; but he reminds me of a story
about a pewter soldier which I had when I was a little boy!” And
then he told his wife about the old house, and the old man, and
about the pewter soldier that he sent over to him because he was so
very, very lonely; and he told it as correctly as it had really been, so
that the tears came into the eyes of his young wife, on account of
the old house and the old man.
“It may possibly be, however, that it is the same pewter soldier!”
