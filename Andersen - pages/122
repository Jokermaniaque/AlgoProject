have from a child followed in your footsteps. As soon as you found
I was capable to go out alone in the world, I went my own way. I am
in the most brilliant circumstances, but there came a sort of desire
over me to see you once more before you die; you will die, I suppose? I also wished to see this land again for you know we always
love our native land. I know you have got another shadow again;
have I anything to pay to it or you? If so, you will oblige me by
saying what it is.”
“Nay, is it really thou?” said the learned man. “It is most remarkable:
I never imagined that one’s old shadow could come again as a man.”
“Tell me what I have to pay,” said the shadow; “for I don’t like to
be in any sort of debt.”
“How canst thou talk so?” said the learned man. “What debt is

“A word is a shadow,” said the shadow, “and as such it must speak.”
It was really quite astonishing how much of a man it was. It was
dressed entirely in black, and of the very finest cloth; it had patent
leather boots, and a hat that could be folded together, so that it was
bare crown and brim; not to speak of what we already know it had seals, gold neck-chain, and diamond rings; yes, the shadow was welldressed, and it was just that which made it quite a man.
“Now I shall tell you my adventures,” said the shadow; and then
he sat, with the polished boots, as heavily as he could, on the arm of
the learned man’s new shadow, which lay like a poodle-dog at his
feet. Now this was perhaps from arrogance; and the shadow on the
ground kept itself so still and quiet, that it might hear all that passed:
