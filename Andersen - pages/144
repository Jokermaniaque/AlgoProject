with the red beard; he sat there, nodded his head, and said, “Look,
what beautiful dancing shoes!”
Then she was terrified, and wanted to fling off the red shoes, but
they clung fast; and she pulled down her stockings, but the shoes
seemed to have grown to her feet. And she danced, and must dance,
over fields and meadows, in rain and sunshine, by night and day;
but at night it was the most fearful.
She danced over the churchyard, but the dead did not dance 
they had something better to do than to dance. She wished to seat
herself on a poor man’s grave, where the bitter tansy grew; but for
her there was neither peace nor rest; and when she danced towards
the open church door, she saw an angel standing there. He wore
long, white garments; he had wings which reached from his shoulders to the earth; his countenance was severe and grave; and in his
hand he held a sword, broad and glittering.
“Dance shalt thou!” said he. “Dance in thy red shoes till thou art
pale and cold! Till thy skin shrivels up and thou art a skeleton! Dance
shalt thou from door to door, and where proud, vain children dwell,
thou shalt knock, that they may hear thee and tremble! Dance shalt
thou !”
“Mercy!” cried Karen. But she did not hear the angel’s reply, for
the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, across roads
and bridges, and she must keep ever dancing.
One morning she danced past a door which she well knew. Within
sounded a psalm; a coffin, decked with flowers, was borne forth.
Then she knew that the old lady was dead, and felt that she was
abandoned by all, and condemned by the angel of God.
She danced, and she was forced to dance through the gloomy
night. The shoes carried her over stack and stone; she was torn till
she bled; she danced over the heath till she came to a little house.
Here, she knew, dwelt the executioner; and she tapped with her
fingers at the window, and said, “Come out! Come out! I cannot
come in, for I am forced to dance!”
And the executioner said, “Thou dost not know who I am, I fancy?
I strike bad people’s heads off; and I hear that my axe rings!”
“Don’t strike my head off!” said Karen. “Then I can’t repent of my
sins! But strike off my feet in the red shoes!”
