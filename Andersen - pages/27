“What’s the hour, watchman?” asked a passer-by. But when the
watchman gave no reply, the merry roysterer, who was now returning home from a noisy drinking bout, took it into his head to try
what a tweak of the nose would do, on which the supposed sleeper
lost his balance, the body lay motionless, stretched out on the pavement: the man was dead. When the patrol came up, all his comrades, who comprehended nothing of the whole affair, were seized
with a dreadful fright, for dead he was, and he remained so. The
proper authorities were informed of the circumstance, people talked
a good deal about it, and in the morning the body was carried to the
hospital.
Now that would be a very pretty joke, if the spirit when it came
back and looked for the body in East Street, were not to find one.
No doubt it would, in its anxiety, run off to the police, and then to
the “Hue and Cry” office, to announce that “the finder will be handsomely rewarded,” and at last away to the hospital; yet we may boldly
assert that the soul is shrewdest when it shakes off every fetter, and
every sort of leading-string the body only makes it stupid.
The seemingly dead body of the watchman wandered, as we have
said, to the hospital, where it was brought into the general viewingroom: and the first thing that was done here was naturally to pull
off the galoshes when the spirit, that was merely gone out on adventures, must have returned with the quickness of lightning to its
earthly tenement. It took its direction towards the body in a straight
line; and a few seconds after, life began to show itself in the man.
He asserted that the preceding night had been the worst that ever
the malice of fate had allotted him; he would not for two silver
marks again go through what he had endured while moon-stricken;
but now, however, it was over.
The same day he was discharged from the hospital as perfectly
cured; but the Shoes meanwhile remained behind.
