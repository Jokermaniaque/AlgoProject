was white, and in this lay the Princess; the other was red, and it was
here that Gerda was to look for little Kay. She bent back one of the
red leaves, and saw a brown neck. Oh! that was Kay! She called him
quite loud by name, held the lamp towards him the dreams rushed
back again into the chamber he awoke, turned his head, and it
was not little Kay!
The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young
and handsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped,
too, and asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried, and
told her her whole history, and all that the Ravens had done for her.
“Poor little thing!” said the Prince and the Princess. They praised

small pair of shoes; then, she said, she would again go forth in the
wide world and look for Kay.
Shoes and a muff were given her; she was, too, dressed very nicely;
and when she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped before the
door. It was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess
shone like a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for outriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The
Prince and the Princess assisted her into the carriage themselves,
