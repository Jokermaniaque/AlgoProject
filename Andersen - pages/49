it was a cask, for green cloth was hung all round it, and it stood on
a large gaily-colored carpet. Oh! how the Tree quivered! What was
to happen? The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
On one branch there hung little nets cut out of colored paper, and

they would upset the Tree. The older persons followed quietly; the
little ones stood quite still. But it was only for a moment; then they
shouted that the whole place re-echoed with their rejoicing; they
danced round the Tree, and one present after the other was pulled off.
“What are they about?” thought the Tree. “What is to happen
now!” And the lights burned down to the very branches, and as
