In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed
the light directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would
always have its master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He
made himself little; he made himself great: but no shadow came
again. He said, “Hem! hem!” but it was of no use.
It was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly;

rattled a whole bunch of valuable seals that hung to his watch, and
he stuck his hand in the thick gold chain he wore around his neck 
nay! how all his fingers glittered with diamond rings; and then all
