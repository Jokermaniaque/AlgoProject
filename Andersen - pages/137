“Do you hear the cock crow, Tukey? Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cocks
are flying up from Kjoge! You will have a farm-yard, so large, oh! so
very large! You will suffer neither hunger nor thirst! You will get on
in the world! You will be a rich and happy man! Your house will
exalt itself like King Waldemar’s tower, and will be richly decorated
with marble statues, like that at Prastoe. You understand what I
mean. Your name shall circulate with renown all round the earth,
like unto the ship that was to have sailed from Corsor; and in
Roeskilde ”
“Do not forget the diet!” said King Hroar.
“Then you will speak well and wisely, little Tukey; and when at
last you sink into your grave, you shall sleep as quietly ”
“As if I lay in Soroe,” said Tuk, awaking. It was bright day, and he
was now quite unable to call to mind his dream; that, however, was
not at all necessary, for one may not know what the future will
bring.
And out of bed he jumped, and read in his book, and now all at
once he knew his whole lesson. And the old washerwoman popped
her head in at the door, nodded to him friendly, and said, “Thanks,
many thanks, my good child, for your help! May the good everloving God fulfil your loveliest dream!”
Little Tukey did not at all know what he had dreamed, but the
loving God knew it.
