her shoes. And Karen stretched out her little foot.
“See, what beautiful dancing shoes!” said the soldier. “Sit firm
when you dance”; and he put his hand out towards the soles.
And the old lady gave the old soldier alms, and went into the
church with Karen.
And all the people in the church looked at Karen’s red shoes, and
all the pictures, and as Karen knelt before the altar, and raised the
cup to her lips, she only thought of the red shoes, and they seemed

When she wanted to dance to the right, the shoes would dance to
the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes
danced back again, down the steps, into the street, and out of the
city gate. She danced, and was forced to dance straight out into the
gloomy wood.
Then it was suddenly light up among the trees, and she fancied it
must be the moon, for there was a face; but it was the old soldier
