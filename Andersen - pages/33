drops fell scalding from the ceiling on his face.
“Holloa!” cried he, leaping down. The bathing attendant, on his
side, uttered a loud cry of astonishment when he beheld in the bath,
a man completely dressed.
The other, however, retained sufficient presence of mind to whisper to him, “’Tis a bet, and I have won it!” But the first thing he did
as soon as he got home, was to have a large blister put on his chest
and back to draw out his madness.
The next morning he had a sore chest and a bleeding back; and,
excepting the fright, that was all that he had gained by the Shoes of
Fortune.
V. Metamorphosis of the Copying-Clerk
The watchman, whom we have certainly not forgotten, thought meanwhile of the galoshes he had found and taken with him to the hospital; he now went to fetch them; and as neither the lieutenant, nor
anybody else in the street, claimed them as his property, they were
delivered over to the police-office.*
“Why, I declare the Shoes look just like my own,” said one of the
clerks, eying the newly-found treasure, whose hidden powers, even
he, sharp as he was, was not able to discover. “One must have more
than the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other,” said
he, soliloquizing; and putting, at the same time, the galoshes in
search of an owner, beside his own in the corner.
“Here, sir!” said one of the men, who panting brought him a tremendous pile of papers.
The copying-clerk turned round and spoke awhile with the man
about the reports and legal documents in question; but when he
had finished, and his eye fell again on the Shoes, he was unable to
say whether those to the left or those to the right belonged to him.
