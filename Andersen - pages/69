“That’s Kay for certain,” said Gerda. “I know he had on new boots;
I have heard them creaking in grandmama’s room.”
“Yes, they creaked,” said the Raven. “And on he went boldly up to
the Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a spinning-wheel.
All the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants’
attendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen’s
gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the

You are hungry, no doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the
palace, for you are barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys
in gold, would not allow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still.
My sweetheart knows a little back stair that leads to the bedchamber,
and she knows where she can get the key of it.”
And they went into the garden in the large avenue, where one leaf
