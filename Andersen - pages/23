“Oh, were I rich! Oft asked I for this boon.
The child grew up to womanhood full soon.
She is so pretty, clever, and so kind
Oh, did she know what’s hidden in my mind

most poignantly, and this was the reason he leant his head against
the window, and sighed so deeply.
“The poor watchman out there in the street is far happier than I.
He knows not what I term privation. He has a home, a wife, and
children, who weep with him over his sorrows, who rejoice with
him when he is glad. Oh, far happier were I, could I exchange with
him my being with his desires and with his hopes perform the
weary pilgrimage of life! Oh, he is a hundred times happier than I!”
In the same moment the watchman was again watchman. It was
