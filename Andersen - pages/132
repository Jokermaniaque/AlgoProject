in the lustre there stood the old grandmother, so bright and radiant,
so mild, and with such an expression of love.
“Grandmother!” cried the little one. “Oh, take me with you! You
go away when the match burns out; you vanish like the warm stove,
like the delicious roast goose, and like the magnificent Christmas
tree!” And she rubbed the whole bundle of matches quickly against
the wall, for she wanted to be quite sure of keeping her grandmother
near her. And the matches gave such a brilliant light that it was
brighter than at noon-day: never formerly had the grandmother
been so beautiful and so tall. She took the little maiden, on her arm,
and both flew in brightness and in joy so high, so very high, and
then above was neither cold, nor hunger, nor anxiety they were
with God.
But in the corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat the poor girl, with
rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall 
frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat
the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been
burnt. “She wanted to warm herself,” people said. No one had the
slightest suspicion of what beautiful things she had seen; no one
even dreamed of the splendor in which, with her grandmother she
had entered on the joys of a new year.
