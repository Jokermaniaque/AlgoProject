of every season, stood there in fullest bloom; no picture-book could
be gayer or more beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy, and played till
the sun set behind the tall cherry-tree; she then had a pretty bed,
with a red silken coverlet filled with blue violets. She fell asleep, and
had as pleasant dreams as ever a queen on her wedding-day.
The next morning she went to play with the flowers in the warm
sunshine, and thus passed away a day. Gerda knew every flower;
and, numerous as they were, it still seemed to Gerda that one was
wanting, though she did not know which. One day while she was
looking at the hat of the old woman painted with flowers, the most
beautiful of them all seemed to her to be a rose. The old woman had
forgotten to take it from her hat when she made the others vanish

earth where all the dead are, but Kay was not there.”
“Many thanks!” said little Gerda; and she went to the other flowers, looked into their cups, and asked, “Don’t you know where little
Kay is?”
But every flower stood in the sunshine, and dreamed its own fairy
tale or its own story: and they all told her very many things, but not
one knew anything of Kay.
Well, what did the Tiger-Lily say?
“Hearest thou not the drum? Bum! Bum! Those are the only two
tones. Always bum! Bum! Hark to the plaintive song of the old
woman, to the call of the priests! The Hindoo woman in her long
robe stands upon the funeral pile; the flames rise around her and
her dead husband, but the Hindoo woman thinks on the living one
