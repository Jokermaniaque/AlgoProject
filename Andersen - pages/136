of Denmark, hand in hand, all with their golden crowns; and the
organ played and the fountains rustled. Little Tuk saw all, heard all.
“Do not forget the diet,” said King Hroar.*
Again all suddenly disappeared. Yes, and whither? It seemed to
him just as if one turned over a leaf in a book. And now stood there
an old peasant-woman, who came from Soroe,** where grass grows
in the market-place. She had an old grey linen apron hanging over
her head and back: it was so wet, it certainly must have been raining. “Yes, that it has,” said she; and she now related many pretty
things out of Holberg’s comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalon;
but all at once she cowered together, and her head began shaking
backwards and forwards, and she looked as she were going to make
a spring. “Croak! croak!” said she. “It is wet, it is wet; there is such a
pleasant deathlike stillness in Sorbe!” She was now suddenly a frog,
“Croak”; and now she was an old woman. “One must dress according to the weather,” said she. “It is wet; it is wet. My town is just like
a bottle; and one gets in by the neck, and by the neck one must get
out again! In former times I had the finest fish, and now I have fresh
rosy-cheeked boys at the bottom of the bottle, who learn wisdom,
Hebrew, Greek Croak!”
When she spoke it sounded just like the noise of frogs, or as if one
walked with great boots over a moor; always the same tone, so uniform and so tiring that little Tuk fell into a good sound sleep, which,
by the bye, could not do him any harm.
But even in this sleep there came a dream, or whatever else it was:
his little sister Augusta, she with the blue eyes and the fair curling
hair, was suddenly a tall, beautiful girl, and without having wings
was yet able to fly; and she now flew over Zealand over the green
woods and the blue lakes.
