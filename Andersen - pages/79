had helms on their heads, and lances and shields in their hands;
they increased in numbers; and when Gerda had finished the Lordâ€™s
Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole legion. They thrust at the
horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and in security. The
angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the cold less, and
went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.
But now we shall see how Kay fared. He never thought of Gerda,
and least of all that she was standing before the palace.
Seventh Story. What Took Place in the Palace of the Snow Queen,
and what Happened Afterward
The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and
doors of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there,
according as the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was
many miles in extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora
Borealis, and all were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never reigned there; there was never even a little bearball, with the storm for music, while the polar bears went on their

middle of this lake sat the Snow Queen when she was at home; and
then she said she was sitting in the Mirror of Understanding, and
that this was the only one and the best thing in the world.
Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did
not observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his
body, and his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some
pointed flat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways,
for he wanted to make something with them; just as we have little
flat pieces of wood to make geometrical figures with, called the
