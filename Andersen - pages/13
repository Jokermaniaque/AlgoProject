THE SHOES OF FORTUNE
I. A Beginning
EVERY AUTHOR has some peculiarity in his descriptions or in his style
of writing. Those who do not like him, magnify it, shrug up their
shoulders, and exclaim there he is again! I, for my part, know very
well how I can bring about this movement and this exclamation. It
would happen immediately if I were to begin here, as I intended to
do, with: “Rome has its Corso, Naples its Toledo” ”Ah! that
Andersen; there he is again!” they would cry; yet I must, to please
my fancy, continue quite quietly, and add: “But Copenhagen has its
East Street.”
Here, then, we will stay for the present. In one of the houses not
far from the new market a party was invited a very large party, in
order, as is often the case, to get a return invitation from the others.
One half of the company was already seated at the card-table, the
other half awaited the result of the stereotype preliminary observation of the lady of the house:
“Now let us see what we can do to amuse ourselves.”
They had got just so far, and the conversation began to crystallise,
as it could but do with the scanty stream which the commonplace
world supplied. Amongst other things they spoke of the middle
ages: some praised that period as far more interesting, far more poetical than our own too sober present; indeed Councillor Knap defended this opinion so warmly, that the hostess declared immediately on his side, and both exerted themselves with unwearied eloquence. The Councillor boldly declared the time of King Hans to
be the noblest and the most happy period.*
