bustling towards him. “I’ve felt so queer all of a sudden; would you
have the goodness to send for a hackney-coach to take me to
Christianshafen?”
The woman examined him with eyes of astonishment, and shook
her head; she then addressed him in German. The Councillor
thought she did not understand Danish, and therefore repeated his
wish in German. This, in connection with his costume, strengthened the good woman in the belief that he was a foreigner. That he
was ill, she comprehended directly; so she brought him a pitcher of
water, which tasted certainly pretty strong of the sea, although it
had been fetched from the well.
The Councillor supported his head on his hand, drew a long
breath, and thought over all the wondrous things he saw around
him.
“Is this the Daily News of this evening?” he asked mechanically,
as he saw the Hostess push aside a large sheet of paper.
The meaning of this councillorship query remained, of course, a
riddle to her, yet she handed him the paper without replying. It was
a coarse wood-cut, representing a splendid meteor “as seen in the
town of Cologne,” which was to be read below in bright letters.
“That is very old!” said the Councillor, whom this piece of antiquity began to make considerably more cheerful. “Pray how did you
come into possession of this rare print? It is extremely interesting,
although the whole is a mere fable. Such meteorous appearances are
to be explained in this way that they are the reflections of the
Aurora Borealis, and it is highly probable they are caused principally by electricity.”
Those persons who were sitting nearest him and heard his speech,
stared at him in wonderment; and one of them rose, took off his hat
respectfully, and said with a serious countenance, “You are no doubt
a very learned man, Monsieur.”
“Oh no,” answered the Councillor, “I can only join in conversation on this topic and on that, as indeed one must do according to
the demands of the world at present.”
“Modestia is a fine virtue,” continued the gentleman; “however,
as to your speech, I must say mihi secus videtur: yet I am willing to
suspend my judicium.”
