air; the most charming blue lights burned the whole night in the
sky, and at last they came to Finland. They knocked at the chimney
of the Finland woman; for as to a door, she had none.
There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went
about almost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened little Gerda’s clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and
boots; for otherwise the heat would have been too great and after
laying a piece of ice on the Reindeer’s head, read what was written
on the fish-skin. She read it three times: she then knew it by heart;
so she put the fish into the cupboard for it might very well be
eaten, and she never threw anything away.
Then the Reindeer related his own story first, and afterwards that

nothing.
“You are so clever,” said the Reindeer; “you can, I know, twist all

But the Reindeer begged so hard for little Gerda, and Gerda looked
so imploringly with tearful eyes at the Finland woman, that she
winked, and drew the Reindeer aside into a corner, where they whispered together, while the animal got some fresh ice put on his head.
“’Tis true little Kay is at the Snow Queen’s, and finds everything
there quite to his taste; and he thinks it the very best place in the
world; but the reason of that is, he has a splinter of glass in his eye,
and in his heart. These must be got out first; otherwise he will never
go back to mankind, and the Snow Queen will retain her power
over him.”
“But can you give little Gerda nothing to take which will endue
