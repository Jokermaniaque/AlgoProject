with delight. For many a year have I not felt as at this moment.”
We see already, by the foregoing effusion, that he is become a
poet; to give further proof of it, however, would in most cases be
insipid, for it is a most foolish notion to fancy a poet different from

remained here must always remain here, sitting at my desk in the
office, and patiently see other people fetch their passports to go
abroad. Such is my fate! Alas!” sighed he, and was again silent.
“Great Heaven! What is come to me! Never have I thought or felt
