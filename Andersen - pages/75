In the morning Gerda told her all that the Wood-pigeons had
said; and the little maiden looked very serious, but she nodded her
head, and said, “That’s no matter that’s no matter. Do you know
where Lapland lies!” she asked of the Reindeer.
“Who should know better than I?” said the animal; and his eyes
rolled in his head. “I was born and bred there there I leapt about
on the fields of snow.”
“Listen,” said the robber maiden to Gerda. “You see that the men
are gone; but my mother is still here, and will remain. However,
towards morning she takes a draught out of the large flask, and then
she sleeps a little: then I will do something for you.” She now jumped

worsted leggins, for it will be cold; but the muff I shall keep for
myself, for it is so very pretty. But I do not wish you to be cold.
Here is a pair of lined gloves of my mother’s; they just reach up to
your elbow. On with them! Now you look about the hands just like
my ugly old mother!”
And Gerda wept for joy.
“I can’t bear to see you fretting,” said the little robber maiden.
“This is just the time when you ought to look pleased. Here are two
loaves and a ham for you, so that you won’t starve.” The bread and
