went, and stepped into our New Market of the present time. It was
a huge desolate plain; some wild bushes stood up here and there,
while across the field flowed a broad canal or river. Some wretched
hovels for the Dutch sailors, resembling great boxes, and after which
the place was named, lay about in confused disorder on the opposite bank.
“I either behold a fata morgana, or I am regularly tipsy,” whimpered out the Councillor. “But what’s this?”
He turned round anew, firmly convinced that he was seriously ill.
He gazed at the street formerly so well known to him, and now so
strange in appearance, and looked at the houses more attentively:
most of them were of wood, slightly put together; and many had a
thatched roof.
“No I am far from well,” sighed he; “and yet I drank only one
glass of punch; but I cannot suppose it it was, too, really very
wrong to give us punch and hot salmon for supper. I shall speak
about it at the first opportunity. I have half a mind to go back again,
and say what I suffer. But no, that would be too silly; and Heaven

bear myself any longer. Where the deuce can the house be? It must
be here on this very spot; yet there is not the slightest idea of resemblance, to such a degree has everything changed this night! At all
events here are some people up and stirring. Oh! oh! I am certainly
very ill.”
He now hit upon a half-open door, through a chink of which a
faint light shone. It was a sort of hostelry of those times; a kind of
public-house. The room had some resemblance to the clay-floored
halls in Holstein; a pretty numerous company, consisting of seamen, Copenhagen burghers, and a few scholars, sat here in deep
converse over their pewter cans, and gave little heed to the person
who entered.
“By your leave!” said the Councillor to the Hostess, who came
