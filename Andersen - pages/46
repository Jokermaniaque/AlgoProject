THE FIR TREE
OUT IN THE WOODS stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was
a very good one: the sun shone on him: as to fresh air, there was
enough of that, and round him grew many large-sized comrades,
pines as well as firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a
grown-up tree.
He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air; he did not
care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when
they were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. The children
often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, or a long row of
them threaded on a straw, and sat down near the young tree and
said, “Oh, how pretty he is! What a nice little fir!” But this was what
the Tree could not bear to hear.
At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another
year he was another long bit taller; for with fir trees one can always
tell by the shoots how many years old they are.
“Oh! Were I but such a high tree as the others are,” sighed he.
“Then I should be able to spread out my branches, and with the
tops to look into the wide world! Then would the birds build nests
among my branches: and when there was a breeze, I could bend
with as much stateliness as the others!”
Neither the sunbeams, nor the birds, nor the red clouds which
morning and evening sailed above him, gave the little Tree any pleasure.
In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare
would often come leaping along, and jump right over the little Tree.
Oh, that made him so angry! But two winters were past, and in the
third the Tree was so large that the hare was obliged to go round it.
“To grow and grow, to get older and be tall,” thought the Tree 
”that, after all, is the most delightful thing in the world!”
