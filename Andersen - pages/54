THE SNOW QUEEN
First Story. Which Treats of a Mirror and of the Splinters
NOW THEN , let us begin. When we are at the end of the story, we
shall know more than we know now: but to begin.
Once upon a time there was a wicked sprite, indeed he was the
most mischievous of all sprites. One day he was in a very good
humor, for he had made a mirror with the power of causing all that
was good and beautiful when it was reflected therein, to look poor
and mean; but that which was good-for-nothing and looked ugly
was shown magnified and increased in ugliness. In this mirror the
most beautiful landscapes looked like boiled spinach, and the best
persons were turned into frights, or appeared to stand on their heads;
their faces were so distorted that they were not to be recognised;
and if anyone had a mole, you might be sure that it would be magnified and spread over both nose and mouth.
“That’s glorious fun!” said the sprite. If a good thought passed
through a man’s mind, then a grin was seen in the mirror, and the
sprite laughed heartily at his clever discovery. All the little sprites
who went to his school for he kept a sprite school told each
other that a miracle had happened; and that now only, as they
thought, it would be possible to see how the world really looked.
They ran about with the mirror; and at last there was not a land or
a person who was not represented distorted in the mirror. So then
they thought they would fly up to the sky, and have a joke there.
The higher they flew with the mirror, the more terribly it grinned:
they could hardly hold it fast. Higher and higher still they flew,
nearer and nearer to the stars, when suddenly the mirror shook so
terribly with grinning, that it flew out of their hands and fell to the
earth, where it was dashed in a hundred million and more pieces.
