THE OLD HOUSE
IN THE STREET, up there, was an old, a very old house it was almost
three hundred years old, for that might be known by reading the
great beam on which the date of the year was carved: together with

see soldiers with halberds, and spouts where the water ran, like dragons and serpents. That was a house to look at; and there lived an old
man, who wore plush breeches; and he had a coat with large brass
