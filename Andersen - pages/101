The pendulum of the great clock went to and fro, and the hands
turned, and everything in the room became still older; but they did
not observe it.
“They say at home,” said the little boy, “that you are so very, very
lonely!”
“Oh!” said he. “The old thoughts, with what they may bring with
them, come and visit me, and now you also come! I am very well
off!”
Then he took a book with pictures in it down from the shelf;
there were whole long processions and pageants, with the strangest
characters, which one never sees now-a-days; soldiers like the knave
of clubs, and citizens with waving flags: the tailors had theirs, with
a pair of shears held by two lions and the shoemakers theirs, without boots, but with an eagle that had two heads, for the shoemakers
must have everything so that they can say, it is a pair! Yes, that was a
picture book!
The old man now went into the other room to fetch preserves,
apples, and nuts yes, it was delightful over there in the old house.
“I cannot bear it any longer!” said the pewter soldier, who sat on
the drawers. “It is so lonely and melancholy here! But when one has
been in a family circle one cannot accustom oneself to this life! I
cannot bear it any longer! The whole day is so long, and the evenings are still longer! Here it is not at all as it is over the way at your
home, where your father and mother spoke so pleasantly, and where
you and all your sweet children made such a delightful noise. Nay,
how lonely the old man is do you think that he gets kisses? Do
you think he gets mild eyes, or a Christmas tree? He will get nothing but a grave! I can bear it no longer!”
“You must not let it grieve you so much,” said the little boy. “I
find it so very delightful here, and then all the old thoughts, with
what they may bring with them, they come and visit here.”
“Yes, it’s all very well, but I see nothing of them, and I don’t know
them!” said the pewter soldier. “I cannot bear it!”
“But you must!” said the little boy.
Then in came the old man with the most pleased and happy face,
the most delicious preserves, apples, and nuts, and so the little boy
thought no more about the pewter soldier.
