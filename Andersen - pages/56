arch of foliage and flowers. The boxes were very high, and the
children knew that they must not creep over them; so they often
obtained permission to get out of the windows to each other, and to
sit on their little stools among the roses, where they could play delightfully. In winter there was an end of this pleasure. The windows
were often frozen over; but then they heated copper farthings on
the stove, and laid the hot farthing on the windowpane, and then
they had a capital peep-hole, quite nicely rounded; and out of each
peeped a gentle friendly eye it was the little boy and the little girl
who were looking out. His name was Kay, hers was Gerda. In summer, with one jump, they could get to each other; but in winter
they were obliged first to go down the long stairs, and then up the
long stairs again: and out-of-doors there was quite a snow-storm.
“It is the white bees that are swarming,” said Kay’s old grandmother.

“Can the Snow Queen come in?” said the little girl.
“Only let her come in!” said the little boy. “Then I’d put her on

And then his grandmother patted his head and told him other
stories.
In the evening, when little Kay was at home, and half undressed,
he climbed up on the chair by the window, and peeped out of the
little hole. A few snow-flakes were falling, and one, the largest of all,
remained lying on the edge of a flower-pot.
The flake of snow grew larger and larger; and at last it was like a
young lady, dressed in the finest white gauze, made of a million little
flakes like stars. She was so beautiful and delicate, but she was of ice,
